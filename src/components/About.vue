      <p class="lead">I work in education because I have a passion to engage young people, communities and individuals through learning. Giving people the opportunity to explore new things, to be creative and imaginative, is something I really value. I am experienced in curating and delivering exciting learning programmes, and in cultivating a diverse audience. I want to make a lasting impact on others through my work.</p>
