      <h2>Interests</h2>
      <p>Apart from being a frontend developer, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors. In the winter, I like to go ski and sometimes go ice fishing. During the summer, I enjoy mountain biking, running, and fishing.</p>
      <p>I like to create websites for fun, trying out new technologies and tools to improve myself as developer and stay up to date with current tech. I love watching ted talks and reading development stories on Reddit.</p>
